## Long story short

According to my qualifications, I am a computational chemist. According to my job titles, I am a software developer and cyber security analyst. To be true to my passions, I am training myself up in the field of data ethics as I care deeply about the rights of users of technology and I am hoping to combine all of these elements in to the next stage of my career.

## What keeps me busy
In my last project I was working as a Research Software Developer in the <a href="https://github.com/cmsg-icl">Computational Materials Science group</a> at Imperial College London. In particular, developing a set of <a href="https://github.com/crystal-code-tools/crystal_functions">functions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/crystal-code-tools/crystal-integrated-notebooks">worfkflows</a> to simplify the use of the CRYSTAL code.

At the moment, I am a Research Software Engineer at UCL, discovering how quantum computing can be applied to quantum chemistry problems.
